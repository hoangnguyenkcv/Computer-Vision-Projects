HW1: Histograms, Filters, Deconvolution, Blending

The goal in this assignment is to get you acquainted with filtering in the spatial domain as well as in the frequency domain.
Laplacian Blending using Image Pyramids is a very good intro to working and thinking in frequencies, and Deconvolution is a neat trick.
 
You tasks for this assignment are:
•	Perform Histogram Equalization on the given input image.
•	Perform Low-Pass, High-Pass and Deconvolution on the given input image.
•	Perform Laplacian Blending on the two input images (blend them together).
