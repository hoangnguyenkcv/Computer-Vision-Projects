HW5: Structured Light

Your goal is to reconstruct a scene from multiple structured light scannings of it.
 - Calibrate projector with the “easy” method
 - Use ray-plane intersection
 - Get 2D-3D correspondence and use stereo calibration
 - Get the binary code for each pixel - this you should do, but it's super easy
 - Correlate code with (x,y) position - we provide a "codebook" from binary code -> (x,y)
        With 2D-2D correspondence
 - Perform stereo triangulation (existing function) to get a depth map
